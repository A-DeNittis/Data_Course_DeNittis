##Assignment 2 code

1. For each of the filenames that begin with "M" in the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/pdb" list the number of lines in each file.
	
	$ wc -l m*

2. Redirect the output from the previous task to a new file named "m_lines.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"

	$ wc -l m* > C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/Data_Course_DeNittis/m_lines.txt

3. For the file "animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/" get an alphabetical list of the unique animal types that were observed and redirect this list to "unique_animals.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"

	$ cut -d "," -f 2 animals.txt | sort | uniq > C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/Data_Course_DeNittis/unique_animals.txt


4. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/" there is a file named "BioLog_Plate_Data.csv"
Write a command that gives a list of the unique carbon substrates the biolog plate measured, and which saves this list as "unique_C-substrates.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/" 
cat animals

	$ cat BioLog_Plate_Data.csv | cut -f5 -d "," | sort | uniq > C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/Data_Course_DeNittis/unique_C-substrates.txt

5. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/data/" write a command that finds the longest .txt file (by number of lines)
	Hint: wc, sort, tail, head

	$ wc -l *.txt | sort -nr | head -2 | tail -1

6. In the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/many_files/" there are a large number of subdirectories. Buried inside these subdirectories are some .txt files that all contain a list of numbers (one interger per line). 
There is a shell script in the directory "~/Desktop/Data_Course/data/data-shell/scripts" called "sum_lines.sh"

Your task is to run this script on ALL the .txt files buried within the "many_files/" directory to output the sums of all the lines in each file. This output (on all those files) should be saved in a single file named "file_sums.txt" in "~/Desktop/Data_Course_YOUR_LAST_NAME/"

	$ find . -type f -name *.txt -exec cp {} "C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/Data_Course/manyfiles_new.txt"/ \;
	
	Aly@LAPTOP-IHG668TO MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Data_Course/manyfiles_new (master)
	$ for fn in *.txt; do bash ../data/data-shell/scripts/sum_lines.sh $fn; done > C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/Data_Course_DeNittis/file_sums.txt
