## Project Background
The data for this analysis comes from an experiment attempting to propagate a threatened plant species from tissue explants using plant tissue culture techniques. One component of data collection for this project is quantifying the average size of plantlets weekly in order to evaluate growth rate over time in response to 9 treatments. ImageJ analysis software is used to calculate the surface area of 2 aspects of each plantlet. The sum of these 2 area values is assigned to each observation as a quantitative measure of size.


```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Plantlet images at various ages from same aspect.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Aly/Documents/ptc_timeseries.png")
```
---

## Data
The following is a sample of the raw experimental data:
```{r data sample, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
df = read.csv("C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/GIT/Final_Project_Files/projectdata.csv")
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
head(df, 10)
```

There are multiple fields that are not necessary for this portion of the analysis, and the data needs to be converted to a usable format:

* Add column with area value sums
* Assign treatments
* Subset to columns for analysis (mostly for aesthetic purposes)
* Dates converted to proper format required for time series analysis
* Other cleaning

For the purposes of this project and coercion for use with specific packages, a new data set was modeled after the raw data to show the steps of analysis.The following is a sample of the dataframe used for this analysis.

```{r new data, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(stats)
ID = c(1:243)
age = c(c(rep(1,243)),c(rep(2,243)),c(rep(3,243)),c(rep(4,243)),c(rep(5,243)),
        c(rep(6,243)),c(rep(7,243)),c(rep(8,243)),c(rep(9,243)),c(rep(10,243)),
        c(rep(11,243)),c(rep(12,243)))
ttx=c(rep(1,27),rep(2,27),rep(3,27),rep(4,27), rep(5,27),rep(6,27),rep(7,27),
      rep(8,27),rep(9,27))
ultdf = data.frame(age, rep(ttx,12), rep(ID,12), row.names = FALSE)

## Analysis

This data can be initially analyzed several ways without any particular specialized packages or models using standard statistical tests and plots. First, the data can be used to determine mean size between treatments at each observation point. This plot shows the mean size of plantlets for each treatment at one observation. 

```{r echo= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
realdf = read.csv("C:/Users/Aly/Desktop/GIT/Final_Project_Files/projectdata.csv")
sizedf = realdf[1:101,]
treat=c(rep(1,12), rep(2,11), rep(3,10), rep(4,11), rep(5,12),rep(6,11),rep(7,10),rep(8,12), rep(9,12))
sumvec = sizedf$V1.Area..cm.2.+sizedf$V2.Area..cm.2.  
sizedf = bind_cols(sizedf, sumvec = sumvec)
sizedf= bind_cols(sizedf, Treatment = treat)
ggplot(sizedf, aes(x=as.factor(Treatment), y=sumvec))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  ylim(0,3.5)+
  theme_bw()+ ylab("Area (cm^2)") +xlab("Treatment")

```

**Summary Statistics**


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
group_by(sizedf, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(sumvec, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(sumvec, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

Graph showing mean with standard errors, with a jitter applied to data points.

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library("ggpubr")
ggline(sizedf, x = "Treatment", y = "sumvec", 
       add = c("mean_se", "jitter"),
       ylab = "Area (cm^2)", xlab = "Treatment", ylim = c(0,3.5))

```

**One-Way ANOVA**

```{r echo=FALSE}
size.aov <- aov(sumvec~Treatment, data = sizedf)
summary(size.aov)
```

Based on the results from the ANOVA, there does not to be a statistically significant difference in mean size of plantlets between treatment groups. Although there does not seem to be a correlation between plant size and growth treatments, this particular subset of the experimental data can be used to analyze several other things.

**Growth Rate Over Time**

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Plantlet images at various ages from same aspect.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Aly/Documents/ptc_timeseries.png")
```


Tissue for this experiment is cultured on media augmented with various nutrients and growth hormones. The tissue then has to be continuously subcultured on fresh media for the duration of *in vitro* growth as nutrients and moisture is depleted. As they do, plantlet vigor starts to decrease. This may result in reduced growth rate, and possibly a reduction in size as plantlets start to die back or dessicate. Determining the growth rate for each treatment observed every 7 days can help to capture and detect these changes to determine ideal times for subculturing (along with other data collected that is not being used in this analysis).For the purposes of this analysis, which uses a dataset modeled after actual experimental data, the following analysis will be conducted on one treatment group in order to demonstrate the methodology.


The graph below shows the mean size per week for this treatment over 12 weeks, which contains intervals in which the size increases and decreases. Plantlets were subcultured at 5 weeks, resulting in an increase in size. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ndsub = subset(ndf, Treatment == 1)
meanvec = group_by(ndsub, Age_wk) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Sum_area, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

ggplot(meanvec, aes(x=Age_wk, y=mean))+
  geom_line() + geom_point()+ylab("Mean Area (cm^2)")+xlab("Age (weeks)") + theme_bw()
```

This can be visualized better by plotting growth rate calculated by dividing each mean by the previous observation mean, and calculating its distance from 0. A value of 0 indicates no growth from the previous observation. Values < 0 represent a decrease in size, while values > 0 represent an increase in size. Growth rate increase at 5 weeks correlates with the plantlets  following subculture, a decrease in the interval indicates that there was less overall growth compared to the previous week. This can possibly help determine at what points growth increases the most, or at what point growth stabilizes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
grvec = c(1,1.84,1.51,1.63,.966,1.51,1.15,1.37,1.08,1.02,1.02,0.892)
plgrvec =c(0,.84,.51,.63,-.34,.51,.15,.37,.08,.02,.02,-.108) 
meanvec = bind_cols(meanvec,plgr=plgrvec)

ggplot(meanvec, aes(x=Age_wk, y=plgrvec))+
  geom_col(width = .4) +
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) +ylab("Growth Rate") + xlab("Age (Weeks)") 
```

**Time Series Analysis**

Although the data can be visualized as a time series in the above plot, the functionality for analysis is incredibly limited. The data will be converted to an appropriate format for time series analysis with the Zoo, xts, and forecast packages.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(zoo)
library(xts)
library(forecast)
```

The data is converted to a matrix, subset, and assigned a converted 'index' of dates for each observation.The resulting plot will be the same as the first graph, but now with all of the functionality for further time series analysis. 

```{r}
tsmat = data.matrix(meanvec$mean)
idx = as.Date(c("2017-12-28","2018-01-04","2018-01-11","2018-01-18","2018-01-25","2018-02-01","2018-02-08","2018-02-15","2018-02-22","2018-03-01","2018-03-08","2018-03-15"))
matx = xts(tsmat, order.by = idx)
```

**ARIMA Modeling**

The goal of this project was to apply ARIMA modeling to the dataset. However, I was not able to successfully execute it with my data for this project. Assuming it was an issue with my experimental data, I created a new data set modeled off the experimental data for a clean data set. This did not solve the issue. I assume the issue lies in my coding or poor understanding of the concepts. The benefit for ARIMA modeling with my data is real time analysis and forecasting for expected plant growth based on general trends, or cycles in which the mean of my growth data increases and decreases. This could be particularly useful for determining the ideal times to subculture plantlets to maintain as high of vigor as possible. Since this study focuses primarily on establishing a protocol for mass producing plantlets, determining these critical points in the tissue culture process could produce a more informed protocol.   

Since I was unable to execute this model with my data, I will go through some of the basic methodology with a preloaded data set.

*Methodology*

Although there are many types of models, I will be doing an ARIMA forecast using the AirPassenger time series data. Here, we can see the time series data and plot. We can fit a line to the data to show the upward trend of the mean.
```{r}
AirPassengers
plot(AirPassengers)+
abline(reg = lm(AirPassengers ~ time(AirPassengers)))
```

In order to run the model, the variance must be equal and the mean constant. As we can see in the plot, the mean and variance changes over time. We need to equalize the variance and differentiate the mean in order to make it constant.
```{r}
plot(log(AirPassengers))
plot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```
The next step would be to determine which type of model to fit by determining if the data is stationary or nonstationary. This can be done by running a Dickey-Fuller Test on the data. A P-Value < 0.05 means that the data is stationary, as can be seen below.
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tseries)
adf.test(diff(log(AirPassengers)), alternative = "stationary")
```
In order to run the model, values for variables "P", "d", and "q" need to be determined using Auto- and Cross- Covariance and Correlation.
```{r}
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
d = diff(log(AirPassengers))
```
Based on the acf, p = 0, d = 1, q = 1. These values are then used to fit an ARIMA model and use it to forecast.Predictions to forecast future data points are then made. Because the values are logarithmic, it needs to be converted back.

```{r}
fit = arima(log(AirPassengers), c(0,1,1), seasonal = list(order = c(0,1,1), period = 12))
pred = predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
pred1 = 2.178^pred$pred
pred1
```
Based on the parameters established in the prediction, the new data set now has predictive values for 10 years. For my data, this would be a significantly smaller time scale, which is established in the n.ahead function. The time series can also be plotted, with the dash line now indicating predicted values based on the model. 
```{r}
ts.plot(AirPassengers,2.718^pred$pred, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
```
